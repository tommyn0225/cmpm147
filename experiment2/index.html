        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Created a landscape generator on Glitch and ported it to my portfolio. The landscape has is based on a reference picture and creates unique variations</p>
		<img class="reference-pic" src="../img/firewatch.jpg">
		<p>The reference image contains multiple layers with different colors on a blue/purple color wheel. The forefront has trees which can be represented with triangles. The mountains in the back need more unique polygons. The sky has a gradient with stars present in the sky. The clouds move to add a sense of life. The mountain layers also move slightly with the user's mouse. The mooon also follows the mouse's x position</p>

        <h2>Technical</h2>
        <p>A simple 2D generator that uses polygons and unique polygons to mimic the landscape shown in reference picture. There is a layer of tall trees made of triangles. 3 layers of mountains. A gradient sky, moving clouds, and the moon which follows the mouse position. The mountains also move with the mouse movement</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>The hardest part was making the landscape still look good while reducing it to simple shapes and colors.</p>
